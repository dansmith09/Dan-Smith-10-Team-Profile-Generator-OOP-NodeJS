# Dan-Smith-10-Team-Profile-Generator-OOP-NodeJS


**Description**

This Node JS application generates a 'Team Summary' website based on responses given by a user.

To start the program inquirer and jest need to be installed using the following command: 

```
npm install
```

Once all dependencies have been installed, navigate to the directory in which the application is located in terminal and run:

```
node index.js
```

The application will first prompt the user to input information about their team's manager.
Once all manager related questions have been answered the user will be asked if they wish to add another team member.
The team member can be either a developer or an intern. Depending on the option they select the questions will differ.
The user can add as many team members as they wish. When they choose to finish building their team the html file will be complete.

The styling for the html is linked to a CSS file in the assets directory.
